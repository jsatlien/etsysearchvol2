I just ask that you take a picture of the box and product and let me know within 48 hours.\r\n\r\n** Also you MUST keep the broken glassware and all packaging until the claim is settled.  I know it is not ideal, but the post is requiring this in some cases, and the claim will not be paid if is not in hand to view.\r\n\r\nIf you do not comply with the procedures required by the post office you are responsible for the amount of the replacement pieces. I go on good faith sending a replacement before the claim is paid out. The post office as we all know takes a bit of time to get things like this handled, so I do not want you to wait for your glassware. \r\n\r\nWe do ship internationally, but those packages do not include any taxes on the buyers end. It also does not include tracking. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions or concerns about this policy and I would be happy to go into detail.

"title": "Cinnamon Whiskey  8 oz Mason Jar Soy Candle Rustic Hand poured",
"description": "Hand poured small batch pure soy candle. Who ordered the fireball shots because that exactly how this candle is scented, strong whiskey with a hint of cinnamon. \n8 oz square mason jar with rustic bronze lid\n\n\nWe pour the best soy wax product available today. It&#39;s 100% vegetable, made with pure, all-natural soybean oil using soy beans that are farm-grown in the U.S. This wax is completely free of paraffin product, which is derived from refined crude oil. \nWe use a flat, coreless cotton wick that is braided with thin paper filaments. These filaments aid in reducing soot and mushrooming at the end of the wick during burning. Each wick is primed with soy wax as well, not paraffin, for a clean burn.\nWe use only premium-grade fragrance oils. \n\nSoy Candle Info:\n-all natural pure soy wax\n-infused with pure essential oils and premium phthalate free fragrances\n-re-usable 8 oz mason jar 3.5&quot; Height 3&quot; Diameter\n-burns cleanly and slowly\n-50-60 hour burn time\n-cotton wicked\n-100% dye free\n-lead free\n\n**Burning Instructions**\nTrim wick to 1/4&quot; before lighting\nKeep burn pool free of foreign objects\nLet wax melt completely to edge before extinguishing. This will discourage tunneling giving the candle the longest life possible.\nDo not burn for more than 4 hours at a time\n\nClean burning, soy candles do not emit toxins or chemicals and are less likely to trigger allergies. Naturally biodegradable and water-soluble, soy wax spills are easy to clean up and do not leave a chemical film on the candle jar. \n\nPhalate free",

"description": "BUY 2 PRINTS AND GET 1 FREE\n► DO NOT PURCHASE YOUR FREE PRINT! Simply write the full name (or paste the link) of the print you would like for free in the &quot;Message to Seller box&quot; during checkout.\n► Free item must be the same price or less than the purchased items.\n► This discount is also stackable--in other words, if you buy 4 prints, you get 2 extra prints for FREE, and purchasing 6 prints gets you 3 for FREE.\n► Also, there is NO EXTRA SHIPPING FEE for prints purchased in the same order. \n______________________________________\nSIMILAR DICTIONARY ART PRINTS IN MY SHOP\n► More CIGAR dictionary art prints here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Lexiconograph/search?search_query=cigar&order=date_desc&view_type=list&ref=shop_search\n► ALCOHOL and BAR ART dictionary art prints here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Lexiconograph/search?search_query=ALCOHOL&order=date_desc&view_type=list&ref=shop_search\n► Dictionary art prints FOR FOODIES here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Lexiconograph?section_id=15099883\n______________________________________\nABOUT MY DICTIONARY ART\n► The pages are &quot;upcycled&quot; from old dictionaries (and sometimes other books) that otherwise would be destroyed. \n► The pages, which are delicately yellowed with age, are carefully removed from the dictionary and trimmed to size. Because each page is unique, your work of art will be one-of-a-kind.\n► The images are carefully designed and crafted and then printed on the old dictionary pages using a high-end printer (Epson 2200). \n► I am constantly testing to make sure that the colors, tone, and brightness of the images are correctly balanced against the print on the dictionary page► These unique prints complement almost any decor -- vintage, modern, apartment or college dorm -- and any room -- office, bedroom, bath, living room, hallway....\n______________________________________\nPRINT SIZE\n► Frames and mats are not included. However, the size of the dictionary pages I use are roughly 11&quot; by 8&quot;-8.25&quot;. This will fit in a mat sized for 8x10&quot; prints (which typically have openings of 7.5 x 9.5&quot;).\n______________________________________\nSHIPPING\n► Prints will be mailed in durable cardboard envelopes, stamped &quot;DO NOT BEND&quot; in red ink.\n► Prints will be shipped via USPS First Class in 2-3 business days, although I try to ship within 24 hours. They typically arrive in 2-3 days. If you want overnight shipping, let me know and I can create a custom order with which you can pay the extra amount.\n► International orders are shipped USPS First Class International. Depending on the customs protocols used in your country, arrival could take anywhere from 7 to 30 days. In order to keep my shipping costs reasonable, I do not provide tracking.\n______________________________________\nWHAT TO EXPECT\n► MY SHOP IS ALL ABOUT PROFESSIONALISM, PROMPT DELIVERY, AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. IN MOST CASES, YOUR ITEM WILL BE SHIPPED WITHIN 24 HOURS.\n► See my 5-star reviews here: https://www.etsy.com/your/shops/Lexiconograph/reviews?ref=shop_info\n► Visit my Etsy shop here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Lexiconograph\n______________________________________\nMONEY-BACK GUARANTEE\n► Each print is created to exacting standards. If you are in any way unsatisfied with the print, let me know, and if we can&#39;t work out any other solution, I&#39;ll be happy to offer you a FULL REFUND upon return of the original. \n______________________________________\nFRAMING IDEAS FOR PRINTS ON PHOTO PAPER\n► Frames for 8X10 prints, with and without mats, are widely available at stores such as Ikea, Target, Walmart, and Amazon.\n► If you really want to choose from a huge selection of frames and mats, go to pictureframes.com.",
